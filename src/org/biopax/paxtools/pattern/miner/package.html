Package for pattern miner utility. This package is not an essential part of the framework, but an
example implementation of pattern search software using the framework. Each miner class is capable
of creating the pattern and writing the result to a text output. The Dialog class is a GUI that
executes the selected miner class on a selected model and writes output to the given file.
