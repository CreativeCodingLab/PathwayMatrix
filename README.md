PathwayMatrix Tung
=============
PathwayMatrix presents an alternative visual representation of biological pathways using an interactive matrix representation instead of a node-linked diagram. PathwayMatrix imports pathway data in BioPAX format.

PathwayMatrix supports interactive capabilities to help users interested in exploring very dense pathway networks. The ability to order by protein arranges similar proteins so that they appear together in the visualization. Smooth lensing allows the viewer to focus on a particular protein or a group of proteins that is of interest. Finally, grouping similar proteins provide a more compressed view of the entire network.

The application (PathwayMatrix_1_1.jar) is available in application.Cross-Platform folder.
