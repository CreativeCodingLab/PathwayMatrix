PathwayMatrix
=============
PathwayMatrix is a visualization tool that presents the binary relations between proteins in the pathway via the use of an interactive adjacency matrix. The glyphs inside each circular cell can indicate concurrent relations between a pair of proteins.PathwayMatrix imports pathway data in BioPAX format.

PathwayMatrix supports interactive capabilities to help users interested in exploring very dense pathway networks. The ability to order by protein arranges similar proteins so that they appear together in the visualization. Smooth lensing allows the viewer to focus on a particular protein or a group of proteins that is of interest. Finally, grouping similar proteins provide a more compressed view of the entire network.

The following figure shows two different views of the HIV life cycle in PathwayMatrix. In the first panel, proteins have been order by similarity. Two proteins are considered to be similar if they perform the same functionalities, and therefore have same sets of interactions to other proteins in the pathway. In the second panel, similar proteins are grouped together to provide a compressed view of the network. Backgrounds of rows and columns are colored by group sizes.



The application (PathwayMatrix_1_1.jar) is available in application.Cross-Platform folder.
